## Chapter 1: Summary of Key Concepts


#### Q: What does a computer system consit of? 
A computer system consist of hardware and software that work together to solve problems


#### Q: What does a CPU do? 
A CPU is the Centeral Processing Unit of a digital computer system. The CPU is generaly composed of the: 
- Main Memory
- Control Unit
- Arithmetic-Logic Unit
The function of the CPU is to execute instruction that make up a computer program. 
The CPU read the program instructions form main memory, executing one at a time unitil the program ends. 


#### Q: What is an operating system? 
An operating system provides a human with am intuitive way to manage a computers resources through a user interface.


#### Q: What is interface to a computer user? 
The interace is a client application that allows a human to interact with a computers data, by Creating new data, Reading data, Updating data, and Deleting data. 


#### Q: How do digital computers (not mechanical computers) store data? 
A digital computer stores information by abstracting it down into pieces and repersenting each piece as a number


#### Q: What is binary and how do we leverage its capabilites? 
- Definition: Binary is used in math and digital-electronics, and is expressed as a number represented in base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, which only uses two symbols: usually "0" and "1".
- Function: Binary used to store and move data in a computer because digital devices that store and manipulate binary data are inexpenise and reliable. 


#### Q: What are N bits? How should I represent them?
- Definition: N-Bits are a pattern that can represent 2^n distinct integer. An n-bit unsigned integer (whole number) can represent integers form 0 - (2^n) - 1. There are exactly 2^n permuations of N bits. Therefor, N bits can represent up to 2^n unique items. AKA: N-Bits are used to repersent unique numbers that are a product of 2^n (2 to the power of any integer reprsented as n)


#### Q: What makes up the "core" of a digital computer? 
The core of a digital computer is made up of main memory, which stores programs and data, and CPU, which executes program instructions one at a time. 


#### Q: What is associated with unique number with a memory location? 
An address is a unique number that is assocaited with memory location.


#### Q: Why is it important to keep electrical power supplied to a computer if it is running a program that stores information in "main memory"? 
If a program is running on a computers main memory, and is store the data in the main memory, then the data must not be important as must have no need to be presisted. In otherwords the main memory is volatile and wipes its storage clean each time the computers power is up. 


#### Q: What are the two distinct surface types in a CD and what is their function? 
The main surface area of Computer Drive (CD) has both smooth areas and small pits. 
0. A smooth area represents a binary of 0 
1. A pit represents a binary of 1


#### Q: What is the "cycle" that forms the foundation of a computers proccesing?
The Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle froms the foundation for computer processing


#### Q: What is the bare minimum to create a computer network? 
You need only 2 computers. 
A network consist of two or more computers connected togethere so they can exchange information. 


#### Q: What are the Pro's, and Con's of sharing a communication line? 
- Pro's = Sharing a communication line is cost effective and simplifies adding new computers to a network
- Con's = Sharing a communciatio line creates delays


#### Q: What is widely used, and effective way to share information and resources throughout and organization?
A Loca-Area Network (LAN)


#### Q: What is a wide-area network that spans the globe? 
The Internet is a Wide-Area Netwrok (WAN)


#### Q: What does every computer that is connected to the internet have that is used to unquielt identify itself? 
Every computer connected to the ineternet has an Internet Protocal (IP) address 


#### Q: What is the software called that is make it easier for people to share information across a network easier? 
The World-Wibe web is software that makes it easy for humans to share information across the internet.


#### Q: What is used to unquiely specify documents and other information types across the Web for a browser to (1)obtain and (2)dispaly? 
A Uniform Resource Locator (URL), is other wise known as a web address, is a reference to a web resource that specifies it's location on a computer network.


#### Q: What is the paradigm of programming this book focuses on? 
Object-Oriented Programming 


#### Q: Do comments in a program affect the programs processing preformance?
Comments do not affect the progams processing preformance. Comment's are a tool to help other programmers understand your code.


#### Q: What type of documentation should be used to provide insight into my code? 
Inline documentaion should provide other programmers with an understanding of your code. Comments should not be complicated, they should make your code obvious.


#### Q: Is Java case sensitive? 
Yes, Java is case sensitive. Uppercase and lowecase of a letter are distinct


#### Q: How should identifier names be written? 
Identifier names should be descriptive and readable.


#### Q: What is proper use of white space or empty space in a program? 
Once again, I need to make programs understandable for my teamates. So the use of white space is to make it easier to reason about. If a team has formating conventions for code, adopt the teams. So everyone is one the same page.


#### Q: What should I adhere to when fromating my document in my program? 
I should adhere to guidelines that I pick up in my academic/ professional journey in the context of the team I am working with.


#### Q: What must my programs code be translated into in order to be executed?
All programms must be translated to a particular CPU's machine language in order to be executed.


#### Q: What computer languages allow programmer to ignore the underlying details of a machine language?
High Level Languages. 
- Examples: 
- - Python.
- - Java.
- - C++
- - C#
- - Visual Basic.
- - JavaScript.


#### Q: What is byte-code, and what is it used for?
Byte-code is a low-level, architecture-neutral representation of the program.
- Byte-code in Function: A Java compiler translates Java source code into Java bytecode which is bytecode.  


#### Q: What exist to help programmers create and modify their code? 
Development Enviroments


#### Q: What is the use of Syntax, and Semantics when writing a program? 
- Syntax: Dicates the rules that form a progam
- Semantics: Dictates the meaning of the program statements


#### Q: Who is responsible for the accuaracy and reliablity of a program? 
The programmers


#### Q: What is one of the many things that can cause a compiler form not producing bytecode? 
Syntax erros are very common reason for a compiler to not produce bytecode


#### Q: What is the use of OOP? 
OOP is a paradigm to help engineers to solve problems which is the purpose for writing a program


#### Q: What does progam design involve? 
Program design invovles breaking down a solution into manageable pieces


#### Q: What are the charactersitc of all objects?
Each object is made up of: 
- State
- Attributes
- Behaviours
- Methods
The relationship of these characterstics is as follows: 
Each object has a state
- each state of an object is defined by attributes
- - each attribute that defines a state on an object, that has a set of unique behaviors
- - - each behavior that is of an attribute that defines a state on an object is defiend by its methods 
- AKA each Object has a state, defiend by its attributes, and a set of behaviors, defiend by its methods


#### Q: What is a class, and what is the relationship between classes and objects? 
A class is the blueprint of an object. 
Multiple objects can be created from one class definition
