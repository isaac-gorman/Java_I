## 1.2 Computer Architecture - Hardware Components 


#### Q: What is computer architecture?
- A: *Computer archicteture is the way a computer is structured*
- A: *Infromation travels between each component across a group of wires called a bus*


#### Q: What is a "bus" in the context of a computers architcture? 
- A: *A bus is a group of wires in the computer that carry data between components such as the CPU and main memory*


#### Task: Draw Figure 1.9, and describe what its is
- A: *The figure is a diagram depicting the architecture of a generic computer*
- A: *The bus: is the wire connecting/ passing data from the core components: CPU and Main Memory. To the periperal devices: Disk Controllers -> Hard Drive, and USB (Secondary Storage), Video Controlers -> I/O devices, to other controllers and periperal devices*


### Key Concept Question: What is the core of a computer made up of? 
- A: *The core of a computer are two things: The CPU, and the Main Memory*
- A: *Main memory stores data*
- A: *CPU executes progam instructions one at a time*


#### Q: What are the two hardware components that make up the core of the computer? 
- A: *Main memory: stores data. Main memory stores active data and programs*
- A: *CPU executes programs in a procedual manner*


#### Q: Where would a progam reside when it is running?
- A: *This program would exist within main memory while its is running, and any of its extra info needed to run the progam*
- A: *The CPU would then execute the program line by line form Main Memory as well as any data the program needs such as numbers in a list, to prefrom its task, the CPU would read that infromation as well*
- A: *The CPU executes the program from the Main Memory, as well as any other data needed for the program from Main Memory till the program ends*


#### Q: What is a peripheral?
- A: *What is known as a peripheral is pertty much every component in a computers architerture other then its Main Memory, and CPU, becuase they operate on outside of the Main Memory and CPU even though they may be housed in the same box*
- A: *Users never interact directly with the CPU or Main Memory, rather they interact with the periheral comopnents in order to in driectly work with them. Also the CPU and Main memory would be useless with out their perihperal components*


#### Q: What are controllers?
- A: *A controler is a devices thta coordiantes the activites of a specific perpheral*
- A: *Think of the controler as a translater and middle man. His main jobs is to handle the differences in communicating data between all the deivices who speak a diffrent language*
- A: *The controlers other part time job is to handle the majority of the actual transmission of infromation allowing the CPU to focus on specialiezed activites*


#### Q: What is also considered a perripheral device?
- A: *I/O devices and other secondary memory devices*
- A: *Data transfer devices allow info to be sent and recived between computers, and they are considered a sepreat category of peripherals*



#### Q: What is a Data Transfer Device?
- A: *A hardware components that facilitaes the exchange of infromation amongst computers, such as a modem*


#### Q: What is a useful way to think of secondary memory devices, and any other data transfer devices?
- A: *It is useful to think of secondary memory, and data transfer devices a I/O devices, because they faciliate the input of data, and a place to output data*
- A: *But for now think of I/O devices as devices that enable users to interact with the computers*
