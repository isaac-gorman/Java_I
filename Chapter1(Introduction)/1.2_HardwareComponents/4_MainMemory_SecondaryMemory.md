## 1.2 Main Memory and Secondary Memory - Hardware Components 

pg 13
#### Q: What are memory locations?
- A: *Memory locations are individual, addressable cells within main memory into which data is stored*

#### Q: What is an address?
- A: *In the context of Main Memory: an address is a numeric value that uniquely identifies a particular memory location in a computers memory*

#### Q: How is main memory stored?
- A: *Main memory is composed of a series of tiny concecuituve cells called "memory locations". And each cell has unique number that represent known as an address*

### Key Concept Q: What is an address?
- A: *In the context of a Main Memory: an address is the unique number assocaited with with a memory location*

#### Task: Draw figure 1.10, and describe what it is depicting?
- A: *The figure is depcting the memory storage and each how each address coresponds with a particualr cell*

#### Q: What occurs when data is stored?
- A: *When data is stored in a memory location, it overwrites and destroys any data that was previously stored at that location, however the process of reading data from the memroy location is not affectedx*


#### Q: What occurs when we need to store information that is greater then several bytes?
- A: *Well generally memory locations consist of 8 bit, or one byte, of data*
- A: *If I need more then 8bits of to store a particual item then the computer will allocate memory to consecutive address to store the data*

#### Q: What is storage capacity?
- A: *Storage capacity is the max amount of bytes that can be stored in a particualr memory device*

#### Q: What is a kilobyte?
- A: *a kilobyte is a unit of binary storage, equal to 2^10, or 1024 bytes*

#### Q: What is a gigabyte?
- A: *a gigabyte is a unit of binary storage, equla to one billion (10^9), or 2^30 bytes*

#### Q: What is a terabyte?
- A: *a terabyte is a unit of binary storage, equal to 2^40 (approxmitley 1 trillion) bytes*

#### Task: Draw the chart of Figure 1.11 that represents the units of binary storage
- A: *The chart is depicting byte units with their corsponding symbol, and byte size in ascedning order from:
 -> byte (2^0),
  --> kilobyte (KB, 2^10)
   --> megabyte (MB, 2^20)
    ---> gigabyte (GB, 2^30)
     ----> terabyte (TB, 2^40)
      -----> petabyte (PB, 2^50)*

### Key Concept: How long does main memory store informtion for?
- A: *Main memory is stored as long as the CPU needs to run a progam or as long as the computer is powered, beaucse main memory is volatile*

#### Q: What is a fairly common size of main memory storage?
- A: *A common storage size is 4GB main memory*
- A: *Large main memroy is more effecient at running programs because they don't have to retrieve infromation from secondary memory as often*

#### Q: What happens to the information within main memory when it is powered off?
- A: *It is lost. USB's and secondary memory devices are usually non-volatile and data persistent*


#### Q: What is "cache" and where and why is it used?
- A: *The cache is small, and fast memory devices that stores the contents of the most frequently used memory locations, the CPU uses the cache to optimize its its access time to instructions and data*
- A: *Modern day CPU's most often contain two caches:*
- - 1. *"Instruction Cache": which is used to speed up the fetching of execuatbele instructions*
- - 2. *"Data Cache":  to speed up the fetching and storing of data*


#### Q: What does a USB drive consist of?
- 1. *small printed circuit boards*
- 2. *circuit elements*
- 3. *USB connector*
- 4. *insulated electrically proteced by plastic, metal, or a rubberized case*

#### Q: What is a magnetic medium?
- A: *A disk is that magnetic medium in a computer*
- A: *The disk is a magnetic medium on which bits are represented as magnetized particles*
- A: *A read/write disk passes over the spinning disk, reading or writing the inforamtion as appropriate*
- A: *A hard drive disk may be a series of multiple disk in a vertical column with its own read/write heads*


#### Task: Draw Figure 1.12 and describe what is being depicted
- A: *A hard disk drive with multiple disk with their own read/write head for reading and writing information*


#### Q: What occured before disk drives where common?
- A: *Before disk drives where main stream magnetic tapes where common as a secondary storage device*
- A: *Magnetic storage tape where very ineffecinet due to the way they access information*
- A: *A disk drive is also known as a "Direct Access Device" due to the capablity of the read/write heads ability to access information directly by moving around mechanically*
- A: *A USB is also a "Direct Access Device" although interstingly enough nothing is accessed mechanically*
- A: *This is due to the two terms Random Access Memory and Read Only Memory being used interchangably*
- A: *Furthermore we don't use tapes anymore due to their inefficeint means of accesssing data. We had to loop through all the uneeded data first, AKA we had to rewound and fast-forward tapes to get the appropriate position. This is why tapes are known as a sequential device rather*


#### Q: What are two terms used to describe memory devices?
- 1. *Random Access Memory (RAM)*
- 2. *Read-Only Memory (ROM)*

#### Q: What is random access memory (RAM)?
- A: *Random Access Memory is interchangble with main memory, and should probably be called read-write memory instead to distingush it's self from read-only memory. RAM is most often used to store working data and machine code, and can be read and chanegd in any order*

#### Q: What is read-only memory (ROM)?
- A: *Read only memory is any memort device whose stored data is stored permanently when the devcies is created, it can be read from but NOT written to*

#### Q: What is the difference between RAM and ROM?
- A: *RAM Random Access Memory is the memory where active programs and information is being stored, while ROM Read-Only memory is refering to a chip in which exsist on a computers motherboard or a portable storage disc, which can only be read, and not altered*


#### Key Concept: What are the two types of surfaces that make up a CD?
- 1. *Small Pits*
- 2. *Smooth Areas*
- - *Small Pits represent a binary of 1 (Small Pits = 1), and Smooth Areas represent a binary of 0*


#### Q: What is a CD-ROM?
- A: *A CD-ROM is a portable secondary memory device in which can only be read. Once it is created infromation is stored permently on it and can not be altered*


#### Q: What are the variations that emerged from the basic CD technoloy?
- *CD-Recordables: a disk that can be used to create CD for music or general storage. Once the CD has been created or burned you can't alter the data. Music CD's that where bought where pressed form a mold, wheares CD-Rs are burned by a laser*

#### Q: What where CD's initially popular for?
- A: *CD's where intially popular for music*
- A: *DVD's can store more bits per square inch then a CD*


#### Q: Why has the use of CD's and DVD's as secondary storage devices declined?
- A: *The use of CD's and DVD's has declined due how much cheaper and effiecent it is to access infromation via a "cloud" storage provider thank to the advancements in networks*


#### Q: What is good rule for the advancment of storage capacity?
- A: *Stograge capacity doubles every 18 months*
