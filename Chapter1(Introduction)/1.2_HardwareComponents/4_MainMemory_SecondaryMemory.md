## 1.2 Main Memory and Secondary Memory - Hardware Components 

pg 13
#### Q: What are memory locations?
- A: *Memory locations are individual, addressable cells within main memory into which data is stored*

#### Q: What is an address?
- A: *In the context of Main Memory: an address is a numeric value that uniquely identifies a particular memory location in a computers memory*

#### Q: How is main memory stored?
- A: *Main memory is composed of a series of tiny concecuituve cells called "memory locations". And each cell has unique number that represent known as an address*

### Key Concept Q: What is an address?
- A: *In the context of a Main Memory: an address is the unique number assocaited with with a memory location*

#### Task: Draw figure 1.10, and describe what it is depicting?
- A: *The figure is depcting the memory storage and each how each address coresponds with a particualr cell*

#### Q: What occurs when data is stored?
- A: *When data is stored in a memory location, it overwrites and destroys any data that was previously stored at that location, however the process of reading data from the memroy location is not affectedx*


#### Q: What occurs when we need to store information that is greater then several bytes?
- A: *Well generally memory locations consist of 8 bit, or one byte, of data*
- A: *If I need more then 8bits of to store a particual item then the computer will allocate memory to consecutive address to store the data*

#### Q: What is storage capacity?
- A: *Storage capacity is the max amount of bytes that can be stored in a particualr memory device*

#### Q: What is a kilobyte?
- A: *a kilobyte is a unit of binary storage, equal to 2^10, or 1024 bytes*

#### Q: What is a gigabyte?
- A: *a gigabyte is a unit of binary storage, equla to one billion (10^9), or 2^30 bytes*

#### Q: What is a terabyte?
- A: *a terabyte is a unit of binary storage, equal to 2^40 (approxmitley 1 trillion) bytes*

#### Task: Draw the chart of Figure 1.11 that represents the units of binary storage
- A: *The chart is depicting byte units with their corsponding symbol, and byte size in ascedning order from -> byte (2^0), --> kilobyte (KB, 2^10) --> megabyte (MB, 2^20) ---> gigabyte (GB, 2^30) ----> terabyte (TB, 2^40) -----> petabyte (PB, 2^50)*
