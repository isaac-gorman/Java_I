## 1.3 Network Connections - Networks


#### Q: What is point to point conection?
- A: *ptp network connection are two network devices that connect directly by wire*


#### Q: How do two computers in the same network interact?
- A: *By communicationg through the wire as it would as components of a single machine*
- A: *If the computers are georgapphcally close its is useful to use a ptp network*
- A: *Althoigh there i sa negative side to having a ptp network in terms of overloading computers on the network and having to add new computers and direct connections each time*

#### Q: What is figure 1.16 depicting?
- A: *It is depcting a ptp connection*
- A: *Notice how each computer connects to one another; now think of the pain in the ass off adding additional computers to it*
- A: *These days local networks are much more practical using wirelsess connections*


#### Task: Draw figure 1.16?
- A: **


#### Q: What is the diffrence in networks of point to point vs simple networks?
- A: *All of the computers in the simple network has its own unique network address, which are used to identify the computers in the networkd*


#### Q: What are the pro's and cons to a shared network?
- Pros. *Cost effective, and adding new computer simple*
- Conss. *Introduces delays, cannot use the communcation line at the same time, they instead have to take turns communciating*


### Key Concept: Pros and Cons of a shared communcation line?
- A: *Sharing a communcation line creates delays but is cost effective, and simplifies adding new computers to the newtrok*


#### Q: What is a technuqie to improve network delays?
- A: *Divding large messages into segments, dubbed "Packets" and sending them as indiviaul packets mixed in with other pieces of messages form other users*
- A: *The pieces are collecteds at the destiantion and reassembled into the og message*
