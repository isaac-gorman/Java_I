#  1.1 Computer Processing 


#### Q: What do all computers system have in common? 
- A: *Computers all process data in a similar way. Before understand how to develop software, take a step back and attemp to understand how a computer process data, and how key components of the computer systems hardware interact to execute my program*


#### Q: What is a computer system made up of? 
- A: *A computer system is made up of hardware and software.*
- A: *Hardware componets are the thing we touch that we configure together to help us compute data. Such as but not limited to chips, boxes, wires, keyboards, routers, memory cards, etc*


## Key Concept: A computer system is made up of hardware and software that work in concert to help us solve problems 


#### Q: Why is a computer systems hardware useless with out instructions to direct them? 
- A: *A program: is a series of instructions that hardware execute one after another "procedually"*
- A: *Software is made up or programs and the data or information that the program uses. Software is jelly to hardwares peanut butter and bread. They are intengible counterparts. Togther they make Batman and Robbin, a bad ass due we can use as a tool to solve problems*


#### Q: What are the four main hardware components of a computer system? 
- A: *Central Processing Unit (CPU)*
- A: *Input/ Output (I/O) Devices*
- A: *Main Memory*
- A: *Secondary Memory*


#### Q: What are each of these components basic roles within the computer system? 
- A: *Centeral Processing Unit (CPU): is the machine or component that executes the individuakl commands of a program*
- A: *Input/ Output (I/O) Devices: allow humans to interact with the computer, examples are: keyboards, voice assitants, mouses, trackpad, and monitors*


#### Q: Where are programs held, and which are their two main categories? 
- A: *Programs and data are held in storage devices called memory*
- A: *The two type are Main Memory, and Secondary Memory*
- A: *Main Memory: Is the storage mechinism that holds the software while it is being processed by the CPU*
- A: *Secondary Memory: is the storage mechinism that stores software in a "relitevly" permenat manner. Usually this is the computers hard disk that is within the computers main box. USB flash drives (Universal Serial Bus) are also used as secondary memory devices. USB's are usually have less memory then the computers hard disk, but are used for their portabilioty*


#### Q: What is Figure 1.1 depecting? 


#### Q: Draw out a very abstracted version of a computer system


## Key Concept: The CPU read the programs instructions from main memory, executing ...


#### Q: The process of executing a program is fundemental to what?
