#  1.1 Computer Processing 


#### Q: What do all computers system have in common? 
- A: *Computers all process data in a similar way. Before understand how to develop software, take a step back and attemp to understand how a computer process data, and how key components of the computer systems hardware interact to execute my program*


#### Q: What is a computer system made up of? 
- A: *A computer system is made up of hardware and software.*
- A: *Hardware componets are the thing we touch that we configure together to help us compute data. Such as but not limited to chips, boxes, wires, keyboards, routers, memory cards, etc*


## Key Concept: A computer system is made up of hardware and software that work in concert to help us solve problems 


#### Q: Why is a computer systems hardware useless with out instructions to direct them? 
- A: *A program: is a series of instructions that hardware execute one after another "procedually"*
- A: *Software is made up or programs and the data or information that the program uses. Software is jelly to hardwares peanut butter and bread. They are intengible counterparts. Togther they make Batman and Robbin, a bad ass due we can use as a tool to solve problems*


#### Q: What are the four main hardware components of a computer system? 
- A: *Central Processing Unit (CPU)*
- A: *Input/ Output (I/O) Devices*
- A: *Main Memory*
- A: *Secondary Memory*


#### Q: What are each of these components basic roles within the computer system? 
- A: *Centeral Processing Unit (CPU): is the machine or component that executes the individuakl commands of a program*
- A: *Input/ Output (I/O) Devices: allow humans to interact with the computer, examples are: keyboards, voice assitants, mouses, trackpad, and monitors*


#### Q: Where are programs held, and which are their two main categories? 
- A: *Programs and data are held in storage devices called memory*
- A: *The two type are Main Memory, and Secondary Memory*
- A: *Main Memory: Is the storage mechinism that holds the software while it is being processed by the CPU*
- A: *Secondary Memory: is the storage mechinism that stores software in a "relitevly" permenat manner. Usually this is the computers hard disk that is within the computers main box. USB flash drives (Universal Serial Bus) are also used as secondary memory devices. USB's are usually have less memory then the computers hard disk, but are used for their portabilioty*


#### Q: What is Figure 1.1 depecting? 
- A: *The diagram is communicating how data is passed around the basic hardware components*
- A: *Secondary Storage*
- A: *Main Storage - Hard Disk*
- A: *CPU executing copied progam line by line*
- A: *Input Device - inputing data into the program that is excuted by the CPU*
- A: *Output Device - outputing the prodcut of the executed progam with the data entered by the input device*


#### Q: What are the steps of how software is executed by a computer system? 
- Step 0: *I instruct the computer to execute software*
- Step 1: *Secondary Storage: The software is stored on some secondary devices, such as the hard disk*
- Step 2: *Copy Migration: A copy of the of the program I want to run on the software is brought into main memory form secondary memory*
- Step 3: *CPU Reads the program: The CPU reads the programs indiviudal instructions from main memory*
- Step 4: *CPU Procedually Executes Progam: CPU begins to execute the program line by line until the program ends. Memory the program is using such as two numbers its adding togther is also stored in main memory. This data is brought in either by from a secondary storage device or a read form an I/O device such as a keyboard. During executing the Output may be dispalyed by an Output device such as a monitor*


## Key Concept: The CPU read the programs instructions from main memory, executing the program line by line till the progam ends. 


#### Q: The process of executing a program is fundemental to what? 
- A: *The process of executing a progam is fundemental to a the operation of a computer. To some degree all computer basically function this way. Storing progams in a secondary bus, copying it over to the main disk, and excuting the program line by line it's CPU while taking in certain inputs form a Input device, and excuting the progam with the inputed data, then outputing said data on to a output device*
