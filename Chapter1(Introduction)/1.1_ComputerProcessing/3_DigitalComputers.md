## 1.3 Digital Computers

#### Q: What are the two fundemental techniques for storing information? 
- A. *Analog and digital*
- A. *Analog: is information that is consistent with the direct proportion of the source of the information*
- A. *Example of Analog Information: An alcohol thermometer is an analog device for measuring tempature. The information that the thermometer measures is in direct proprtion to the tempature in the tube due to alcholo. Another example would be an electronic signal used to represent the vibrations of a sound wave*
- A. *Take Away: An analog device dosen't alter the information it represents, inputs are not altred for outputs, rather it uses the input to alter the device to produce an output*


#### Q: What is Figure 1.3 depecting? 
- A. *The figure is depecting how the sound waves form our voice is used to by a microphone to output analog signal of the sound wave*


## Key Concept: Digital Computers store information by breaking it into pieces and representing each piece as a number. AKA digital devices aim to solve the issues with Analog devices by encoding data as clear cut and discret units such as 1's and 0's. Instead of always changing wave forms that are very sensitive to interferance.

#### Q: What is the difference between Digital and Analog devices? 
- A. *Digital Devices: use a digital signal that can only be represneted as one of discret sets of values either 0's of 1's. Furthermore, digital signals can be copied an infinate amount of times without altering the integrity of the signal*
- A. *Analog Devices: An analog device can take an analog signal wich can take any value within a given range in time. Also as analog signals travel they become weaker over time, in addition to all kinds of interferences can can create noises*


#### Q: How does digital technology represent the information it has broken down? 
- A. *digital tech breaks down information into discrete pieces and repsesnts them as 1's and 0's*
- A. *For example: Music can be stored on a compact disc digitally as a series of binary*
- A. *Each number represents the voltage of one specific instance of the music recording, the volatge is measured in many instances a second up to 44,000 measurments a second. The number of measurments per second is also known as "Sampling Rate"*



#### Q: What do we call the process of converting analog information into a digital format? 
- A. *Sampling Rate*


#### Q: Is sampling unique?
- A. *No, there are other ways to digitize information*
- A. *Example: A sentence of text is digitzed by being stored as a series of numbers, where each number resperents a single chartecter in the sentece*

#### Q: How are the characters of the sentence represented?
- A. *Each character of symbol, or space is reresented as unquie number*
- A. *Upper and lower case letters are also represneted as unique numbers*


#### Q: What type of computers do we use today? 
- A. *Digital computers*
- A. *All information: text, images, numbers, audio, video, and even program instructions are broken into pieces.*
- A. *Each "piece" is represnetd as a unique number and is stored as numbers in dgital computer, and is complied by a CPU during runtime*
