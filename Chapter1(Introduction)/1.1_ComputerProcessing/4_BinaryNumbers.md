## 1.4 Binary Numbers

#### Q: Do digital computers store information as decimal values? 
- A: *Digital computers store info as numbers but not as decimal values*
- A: *All data in a computer is managed and stored as number system called binary numbers*
- A: *Unlike the decimal system which is a 10 based system (0-9) the binary number system is made up of only two digits 0 and 1*
- A: *A single binary unit is called a "Bit"*

#### Q: What rules do all number systems work with? 
- A: *The rule all number systems use is called the "Base Value" of numbers.*
- A: *The base value of a number system detrimines how many digits we have to work with and the place value of each digit in a number*
- A: *In other words the base value is how many numbers you can work with in a number system. In the binary system we only have two values 1 and 0. Compared with the decimal base value which is ten values 0 - 9*

### Key Concept: Binary is used to store information in a computer beacuse the devices that store and manipulate binary data are inexpensive and reliable. 


#### Q: Why do modern computers use binary? 
- A: *Because the devices used to use the binary system are inexpenisve and reliable*


#### Q: Why are computer memory devices magnetic? 
- A: *Devices such as hard drives are magnetic because: magnets naturally have two extrem charactersitcs postive and negative, and are polarized to either one extrem or the other, which we use on the hard drive to store 1's in magnetized areas, and 0's in demagnetized areas.*


#### Q: What goes hand in hand with binary values? 
- A: *Digital values and binary go hand in hand*
- A: *Instead of having to reprsent the various analogs signal strength in voltage 5V to -5V. Binary simplifies it to any "high" Voltage as 1 and any "low" voltage as 0*


#### Q: What is Figure 1.6 depecting and why?
- A: *The figure is depcting how much more simple/ effecient the digital signal is compared to the random variations in an analog signal*


#### Q: What occurs to signals over time? 
- A: *Signal weakens over time as it moves down a wire due to enviromental conditions*


#### Q: What are bits used to determine? 
- A: *Bits used deterimne the number of unique items represented*
- A: *This is beacuse their are exsactly 4 permuations of of two bits: 00, 01, 10, 11*



#### Q: Two bits taken together can represent what? 
- A: *Two bits can represent 4 items becuase 2^n*
-




#### Q: Three bits can represent what? 
- A: *2^3 = 8 items*
- A: *3 bits = 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111*



### Key Concept: There are exactly 2^n permutations of N bits. Therefore, N bits can represent up to 2^n unique items.



#### Q: What is Figure 1.7 depciting. 
- A: *A chart depicting the breakdown of items available for every bit*



#### Q: How many items can be represented by 6 bits and why? 
- A: *64 items?*


#### Q: How is text stored in a computer? 
- A: *Binary, by mapping characters to numeric values.*
- A: *If I wanted to represent characters in a string language that contained 256 unique characters and symbols, I would *




#### Q: How many bits would be needed to represent 195 countries around the world? 
- A: *Formula to deterime bits to items: itmes = 2^X. X being the bits *
- A: *We would need 8 bits which can contain 256 items*



#### Q: How should I think of determining how information is store on a digital computer? 
- A: *First: define how many items I want to store*
- A: *Second: evaulate the expression 2^bits = item#*
- A: *For example: 2^n = 256 would evaluete to by loging both sides to 8 = bits*
- A: *Depending on the system I am using you may have to determine how the items are mapped to the binary values*
